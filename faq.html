						<div class="header_text header_text_faqBlock1"></div>
					</div>
					<h2 class="faqBlock1_h2_1">Are there any extra taxes charged on my profits?</h2>
					<p>
						The client`s profits are not imposed by any taxes from our side. 
However, it is the client`s own responsibility to review the applicable tax 
laws in his/her country of residence.
					</p>
					<h2>
						What is called the “underlying financial asset”?
					</h2>
					<p>
						The underlying asset is the financial instrument (such as stocks, futures, 
commodities, currency or indices) on which a derivative's price is based. 
The derivative`s price is correlated (directly or inversely) to the price of the 
underlying asset.There are four major markets that most common assets 
refer to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Currencies (USD/JPY, USD/CHF, etc.)</li>
						<li>Commodities (Gold, Oil, Sugar, etc.)</li>
						<li>Stocks (SNAP Inc., Facebook Inc., Yahoo Inc, etc.)</li>
						<li>Indices (Dow Jones, NASDAQ Composite, The Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, S&P 500, etc.)</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="faqBlock1_h2_2">
						Why is a certain asset not available for me?
					</h2>
					<p>
						Different account types have a great number of assets included. 
If you`d like to trade a certain asset, you should contact your account 
manager.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 faqBlock_right">
					<h2 class="faqBlock1_h2_3">
						Why can`t I open any trades?
					</h2>
					<p>
						You need to verify your account first in order to start trading. 
Note that to open more trades, you should have enough of free margin 
in your trading account.
					</p>
					<h2>
						What is a CFD?
					</h2>
					<p>
						CFDs are tradable contracts between a client and a broker, who are 
exchanging the difference in the current value of a share, currency, 
commodity or index and its value at the contract’s end. 
CFDs provide investors with the all the benefits of owning a security 
without actually owning it
					</p>
					<h2>
						What kind of trading order is stop-loss?
					</h2>
					<p>
						A stop-loss order is a trader`s useful tool used in almost every trading 
strategy. This order is considered as an exit plan to limit the risk of a 
trade. The order is placed through a broker to close an active trade 
once the price of an asset hit a certain level of loss. 
For example, you bought 100 stocks at the price of $10 and expect it 
to reach $12 later this month, but you are not willing to suffer serious 
losses in case it does not, so you put a stop-loss order at 9$. 
If the price for the stock suddenly declines, your order will be fulfilled 
and your position will be automatically closed, saving you from a 
possibly greater loss. 
Note that you should use a stop-loss order wisely, and at your own 
discretion.

						How can I withdraw funds from my account?
					</h2>
					<p>
						The withdrawal function is available in your trading account. 
Simply select the “Withdraw” button. 
Then enter the amount and click on “Withdraw”; your account manager 
will contact you then to confirm the withdrawal. The procedure usually 
takes up to 5 business days, Also, some extra time might be taken by your 
bank to transfer your funds to your account. 
Thus, INVcenter cannot be responsible for any further delays.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6 faqBlock_right">
					<h2 class="faqBlock2_h2_2">
						How fast will I receive my withdrawal?
					</h2>
					<p>
						The process requires an approval from your credit card company and 
also from the bank. 
This way the funds are usually received within a couple of days after 
this transaction is fulfilled. It may take up to 5 business days to 
approve and handle the withdrawal.
					</p>
					<h2 class="faqBlock2_h2_3">
						What payment methods are available to withdraw 
funds from my account?
					</h2>
					<p>
						The funds that you used as a deposit to your account can only be 
transferred back using the exact way that you previously used to make 
the deposit to you trading account. Though, when you withdraw your 
profits, you are able to use any suitable method that is in our list. 
For example: Let`s say you have initially invested $4000, and you used 
a wire transfer to do so. Then you had a certain number of successful 
trades and made $3000 of profit. And now you`d like to withdraw the 
full amount of $7000. 
This way, the $4000 used as your investment will be sent to you by a 
wire transfer, however, the other part of $3000 can be processed by 
any payment method that is accepted by us.

It is important to remember that as soon as your account is created it is 
not possible to change the currency.
					</p>
					<h2>

					</h2>
					<p>
						There are a number of methods you can use to fund your account - 
your credit card, an e-payment or a wire transfer.

					<h2 class="faqBlock3_h2_2">
						What is the process of verification of 
my trading account?
					</h2>
					<p>
						You will have to upload a few documents in order to verify your account. 
First, a clear, full-colored photo or a scan of your ID card or passport and 
a photo or a scan of the document that verifies your residence - any type 
of your utility bill or bank statement that is not older than 3 months. 
Also, a photo or a scan of both sides of your credit card if you used it 
to make a deposit. Just hide the first 12 digits of the card and the 
CVV code as well.
					</p>
					<h2 class="faqBlock3_h2_3">
						I am having issues with my account login.
					</h2>
					<p>
						First, try checking your password in case you typed it incorrectly (better to 
avoid by using the ‘copy and paste’ option). 
Secondly, errors might occur if your browser keeps your old passwords in 
cookies. So, just enter your browser settings and clear the cookies, if the 
problem remains, you could use another browser to enter your details.
