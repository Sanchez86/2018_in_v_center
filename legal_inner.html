                        <li>Execution Practices in the Financial Instruments - Slippage<br>
You are warned that Slippage may occur when trading in Financial Instruments. This is the situation when at the time that an Order is presented for execution, the specific price showed to you may not be available; therefore, the Order will be executed close to or a number of pips away from your requested price. So, Slippage is the difference between the expected price of an Order, and the price the Order is actually executed at. If the execution price is better than the price requested by you, this is referred to as Positive Slippage. If the executed price is less favorable than the price requested by you, this is referred to as Negative Slippage. Please be advised that Slippage is a normal element when trading in Financial Instruments. Slippage more often occurs during periods of illiquidity or higher volatility (for example due to news announcements, economic events and market openings and other factors) making an Order at a specific price impossible to execute. Your Orders may not be executed at declared prices. Slippage may appear in all types of accounts we offer. It is noted that Slippage can occur also during Stop loss orders, Limit orders, and other types of Orders. We do not guarantee the execution of your pending Orders at the price specified. However, we confirm that your Order will be executed at the next best available market price from the price you have specified under your pending Order.

                       <h3>Annex 1 – Bonus Policy</h3>
                        <p>To be eligible to receive a bonus or promotion from the Company, you must have made a minimum deposit of 300 USD/EUR/GBP.</p>
<p>Each bonus offer is provided on a one-time and limited time basis.</p>
<p>Bonuses are immediately available for trading.</p>
<p>Bonuses are only available for withdrawal after trading 40 times the volume of the bonus value. (For example, if a $30 bonus is granted, a trader must complete a total trading volume of $1200 before the bonus is available for withdrawal [withdrawals are subject to the client’s account balance).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Point 4, bonuses exceeding $ 4, 999 and $ 9,999 shall be subject to trading volume requirements of 60 times and 80 times the value of the respective bonuses before becoming available for withdrawal.</p>
<p>In the event that the entire, or part of the deposit, on which the bonus is given is withdrawn before the bonus amount has been traded 40 times, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>The bonus shall be cancelled.</p>
<p>In the case of trading loses, all losses will be borne by the original deposit and the remaining balance may be withdrawn.</p>
<p>In the case of trading profits, the trading profits shall be cancelled and the original deposit may be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Bonuses which are awarded as “Broker’s Money” shall be available for withdrawal after trading 10 times the volume of the bonus value. All other conditions described in sections 1-6 apply.</p>
<p>Risk Free/Insured Trades- For any ‘risk free/insured trades’, all participating users understand that in the event of a trading loss, fxleader.com will reimburse the trader with bonus funds to their account balance. The value of the bonus is determined by the total loss from all insured trades and will in no event exceed the value of the funding deposit. If at any point a trader withdraws the initial deposit amount from their account, FXLeader reserves the right to cancel the ‘risk-free/insured trades’ offer and all losses will be deducted from the account of the user.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the rights to change or cancel any bonus or promotion at their discretion.</p>
<h3>Annex 2 - Privacy and Security</h3>
<p>SAFETY TIPS</p>
<p>When using fxleader.com, or any online trading site, there are measures each trader should take to ensure their personal security:</p>
<p>Registration- We highly recommend that traders take extensive precautions to ensure that their usernames and passwords are not seen by any unauthorized persons. FXLeader trader passwords are encrypted and cannot be seen by any FXLeader personnel or staff. FXLeader will under no circumstances ask a client to disclose their password. Any such request should be viewed by traders as a security breech and immediately reported to the customer care centre.</p>
<p>Password- FXLeader recommends that traders use a combination of characters and digits that are hard to be deciphered. Traders would also be well-advised to periodically request a new password in order to maintain maximum security. If at any point a trader comes to believe that their password’s security has been compromised, they should immediately contact FXLeader’s customer care centre and change their password.</p>
<p>PRIVACY ON FXLEADER.COM</p>
<p>Personal Information-	We highly recommend that traders take extensive precautions to ensure that their usernames and passwords are not seen by any unauthorized persons. FXLeader trader passwords are encrypted and cannot be seen by any FXLeader personnel or staff. FXLeader will under no circumstances ask a client to disclose their password. Any such request should be viewed by traders as a security breech and immediately reported to the customer care centre.</p>
<p>Encrypted Information-	All the data shared between FXLeader and our traders personal computers has been encrypted using a ‘128 bit ssl encryption certificate’. Secure information, such as passwords, is maintained in an encrypted format. The FXLeader data tech staff oversees all internal activities, including systematic checks to ensure that the site’s security integrity is maintained.</p>
